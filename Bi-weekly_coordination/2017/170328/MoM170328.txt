Arrowhead Framework development telco 170328

1) Harmonisation of Arrowhead Framework, Pal
- Different versions of
-- ServiceRegistry, 
-- Orchestration, 
-- Authorisation, certificate and ticket

JD informed about the discussion held in two telcos.

The discussion has only advanced to the ServiceRegistry.
The major proposals so far are:

Discussion on Service naming.
- Seams that the book definition is OK

Discussion on search for meta data in the DNS TXT field through the ServiceRegistry
- Agreement that this is desirable!
- Possibly implemented in the Java code by BNearIT


Discussion on providing support for ServiceRegistry access through different SOA protocols.
- Enables introduction of new services to a local cloud and a ServiceRegistry by only requiring that the ServiceRegistry service is a WELL KNOWN. 
- Can be implemented through the Simple ServiceRegistry API.


2) Eventhandler and QoSManager/Monitor are being worked on. Both are tested with v3.2.  Patches applied to the orchestration system to make it work.
