1) System service  matrix, review, Fredrik, Mats
The updated version was presented and discussed.
It was concluded that the ServiceRegistry system is special from a deployment and startup view point.
The concluded thinking is:
The ServiceRegistry exhibits a DNS-SD interface
The ServiceRegistryBridge exhibits interfaces to SOA protocols like e.g. HTTP, CoAP, MQTT, ... and bridges them to DNS-SD

A still open discussion is on how versioning numbering should be displayed: baseline and artifact version.
This also have to be tide to SD, IDD, CP and SP documents in a structured way.

Finally it was considered how links to documentation could be made. The idea of implementing the SystemService matrix in the wiki was lifted. No conclusion was made.
